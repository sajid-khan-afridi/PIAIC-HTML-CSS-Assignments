        <h1>Our story</h1>
        
        <p>The Upwork story begins over two decades ago when the tech lead of 
a Silicon Valley startup realized his close friend in Athens would
 be perfect for a web project. The team agreed he was the best
  choice, but were concerned about working with someone halfway 
  around the globe.</p>

<p>The team agreed he was the best choice, but were concerned 
about working with someone halfway around the globe.</p>
<h1>A better way of working remotely</h1>
<p>In response, the two friends created a new web-based platform 
that brought visibility and trust to remote work. It was so 
successful the two realized other businesses would also benefit 
from reliable access to a larger pool of proven talent, while 
workers would enjoy freedom and flexibility to find jobs online. 
Together they decided to start a company that would deliver on 
the promise of this technology. Fast-forward to today, that 
technology is the foundation of Upwork â€” the leading flexible 
talent solution. With millions of jobs posted on Upwork annually, 
independent professionals are earning money by providing companies 
with over 5,000 skills across more than 70 categories of work.</p>
