    <h1>PIAIC</h1>
<h3 id="shadowblur">PRESIDENTIAL INITIATIVE FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND COMPUTING</h3> 
<p>Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intelligence and Computing (PIAIC) is a 
privately funded notfor-profit educational initiative started by President of 
Pakistan, Dr. Arif Alvi, Kazi Rahat Ali, and Zia Khan to help promote education, 
research and business opportunities in emerging tech fields like</p>

    <h3 class="h3firstcharacter">Cloud Native computing: </h3>
The <b>Cloud Native Computing</b> program prepares the students to program in open 
source technologies like, <b class="italic">Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, JavaScript, Node.js, 
React and React Native</b> while introducing the students to development of 
Microservices and software development techniques on cloud platforms like AWS. 
</p>

<p>
<h3 class="h3firstcharacter">Artificial Intelligence:</h3> 
The <b>artificial intelligence</b> program of PIAIC takes the student through the 
foundation of the AI technology, via teaching programming in open source 
languages like <b class="italic">Python, Numpy, Pandas, Tensorflow 2.0 and Flask</b>, and teaching 
deploying practical AI solutions and use cases, and ending with real-life 
examples of modern day AI in practice. 
</p>

<p>
    <h3 class="h3firstcharacter">Blockchain:</h3> 
The main emphasis of <b>Blockchain</b> program is to understand the blockchains 
like <b class="italic">Ethereum and Hyperledger (Fabric),</b> and learn to program in languages 
such as Solidity, JavaScript on frameworks like Node.js. The program also 
introduces them to development of Distributed Apps (DApps), frameworks like 
Web3 and Truffle and an in-depth understanding of Blockchain-as-aservice (BaaS) 
and how to develop and offer an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of a crypto-token.
</p>


<p>
    <h3 class="h3firstcharacter">Internet of Things: </h3>
The <b>Internet of things</b> program introduces the students to open source 
development technologies like <b class="italic">Rust, Embedded Rust, WebAssembly, Hyper, 
Diesel, Google Assistant, and Kubernetes</b> while making them efficient in 
developing Micro Services for IoT Edge, IoT Cloud, and voice computing 
for device control.
